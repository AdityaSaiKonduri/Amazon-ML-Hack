# AI-Driven Dimensional Data Extraction for Large-Scale Image Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains the machine learning model developed for the Amazon ML Hackathon. The project utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Roboflow to perform dimensional data extraction from large-scale image datasets. The primary goal was to achieve high precision in automatically identifying and extracting size dimensions from images for various applications.

## Features
- **Dimensional Data Extraction**: Uses YOLO for accurate and efficient detection of object boundaries and dimensions.
- **Large-Scale Image Processing**: Trained and tested on over 100,000 images, demonstrating the model's scalability and robustness.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved a 50% F1 score, indicating a balanced precision and recall, suitable for practical applications.

## Model Performance
The model showed significant improvements in accuracy and a systematic reduction in loss metrics throughout the training phase:
- **Training Loss**: Consistently decreased, reflecting the model's increasing accuracy over time.
- **Validation Accuracy**: Showcased the model's effectiveness on unseen data.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **YOLO**: For object detection and dimensional analysis.
- **Roboflow**: For image annotation and pre-processing to improve model training efficiency.
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **EasyOCR**: Integrated for text recognition from detected objects.
